                    Hi, I'm Ahmed â€” a passionate Front-End Developer who builds modern, responsive, and user-friendly web interfaces. I specialize in turning creative ideas into functional and elegant websites using a solid tech stack that includes:

                    HTML | CSS | JavaScript | React JS | TypeScript | Tailwind CSS | SASS | Bootstrap

                    I'm currently focused on mastering React and TypeScript, and I enjoy working with Tailwind CSS and SASS to create clean, maintainable UI components. I pay strong attention to detail, and I always aim to write scalable code that performs well across all devices.

                    I'm continuously learning, always experimenting with new tools and frameworks, and committed to building projects that make a real difference.

                    Outside of coding, I love improving my English, exploring new technologies, and working on personal projects that challenge my creativity and logic.
